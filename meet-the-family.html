                                            Born into slavery in Walton County on <b>June 26, 1858,</b> Alonzo Franklin
                                            Herndon
                                            grew up on a farm in Social Circle,
                                            Georgia, 40 miles east of Atlanta. He was the son of his white master, Frank
                                            Herndon, and a slave, Sophenie. Emancipated
                                            at the end of the Civil War in 1865, Mr. Herndon was sent away from his
                                            birthplace by his father. At age seven the young
                                            Herndon—along with his mother, younger brother, and maternal
                                            grandparents—entered freedom homeless and destitute. At a
                                            very young age he worked as a laborer and peddler, helping his family eke
                                            out a living in the harsh rural area. Like so
                                            many newly emancipated Blacks, the Herndons engaged in sharecropping—a
                                            system that kept them only a short step from
                                            slavery for many more years. Even as a boy, however, Mr. Herndon exhibited
                                            an entrepreneurial spirit. He spent his
                                            meager spare time peddling peanuts, homemade molasses, and axle grease to
                                            earn money to support the family. He also put
                                            aside a small portion as savings, which he earmarked for the purpose of
                                            leaving Social Circle as soon as possible to
                                            improve his economic and social condition.

                                            barber before moving on to Atlanta. Arriving in early 1883, Mr. Herndon

                                            Marietta Street owned by William Dougherty Hutchins, an African-American.
                                            After six months Herndon purchased half
                                            interest in the shop, entering into a partnership with one of the few free
                                            blacks operating barbering establishments
                                            since before the Civil War.

                                            Mr. Herndon’s barbering business expanded, and by 1904 he owned three shops
                                            in Atlanta. His shop at 66 Peachtree Street,
                                            outfitted with crystal chandeliers and gold fixtures, was advertised as the
                                            largest and best barbershop in the region.
                                            According to the Atlanta Journal, Herndon and his all-black barbering staff
                                            were “known from Richmond all the way to
                                            Mobile as the best barbers in the South.” Following the racial practices of
                                            the era, the black barbers served an
                                            exclusively white clientele composed of the city’s leading lawyers, judges,
                                            politicians, and businessmen. As proprietor,
                                            Herndon personally saw to the barbering services provided to some of the
                                            most important figures in the state, earning
                                            their acquaintance and good will. His success in barbering was spectacular,
                                            and as his earnings grew, he invested in
                                            real estate in Atlanta and in Florida. Eventually he acquired more than 100
                                            houses, a large block of commercial property
                                            on Auburn Avenue, and a large estate in Tavares, Florida. At his death in
                                            1927, his real estate was assessed at nearly
                                            $325,000.

                                            As his personal fortune grew, Mr. Herndon entered the field of insurance. In
                                            1905 he purchased a failing mutual aid
                                            association, which he incorporated as the Atlanta Mutual Insurance
                                            Association. With Mr. Herndon playing a pivotal role
                                            as president and chief stockholder, the small association expanded its
                                            assets from $5,000 in 1905 to more than $400,000
                                            by 1922. In 1922 the company was reorganized as the Atlanta Life Insurance
                                            Company and achieved legal reserve status, a
                                            position enjoyed by only four other black insurance companies at that time.
                                            The firm grew rapidly in the 1920’s,
                                            expanding its operations into a half dozen new states, including Florida,
                                            Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Tennessee, and
                                            Texas.

                                            Mr. Herndon also sought to save other failing black enterprises. Whenever
                                            possible, he reinsured the policyholders and
                                            merged the faltering business into Atlanta Life in an effort to conserve
                                            confidence in black businesses and save jobs
                                            for black men and women. Despite several crises in the industry and lean
                                            times generally, Atlanta Life under Mr.
                                            Herndon’s leadership survived and progressed into the next decades as a
                                            secure and prosperous business.

                                            involvements. He gave generous support and
                                            resources to such local institutions and causes as the YMCA; Atlanta
                                            University; the Leonard Street, Carrie Steele, and

                                            Church. He also supported commercial
                                            activities, including the South View Cemetery Association and the Atlanta
                                            State Savings Bank. Mr. Herndon’s business

                                            African American community looked to him for
                                            leadership in a number of areas. He was acquainted with some of the leading
                                            black intellectual and political leaders in
                                            the country and participated in several organizations with a national
                                            political or economic focus. In 1900, Mr. Herndon
                                            joined Atlanta delegates attending the founding meeting of the National
                                            Negro Business League, convened by Booker T.

                                            Mr. Herndon was among the 29 men who attended the founding meeting in 1905.

                                            Mr. Herndon’s prominence and influence were enhanced by his family life. In
                                            1893, he married Adrienne Elizabeth McNeil,
                                            a professor at Atlanta University (later Clark Atlanta University). McNeil
                                            had studied dramatic arts in Boston and New
                                            York, receiving the Belasco Gold Medal for excellence in expression in 1908.
                                            Their marriage had a far-reaching impact on
                                            Mr. Herndon’s life, greatly influencing his cultural and educational growth.
                                            It also produced his only child, Norris,
                                            who succeeded him as chief executive of Atlanta Life Insurance Company.
                                            After his first wife’s death in 1910, Mr.
                                            Herndon married Jessie Gillespie of Chicago, whose influence and support
                                            also aided her husband in his business and
                                            social life. After her husband’s death Jessie Herndon assumed a position on
                                            the board of directors of Atlanta Life and,
                                            with her stepson, assumed control of the enterprise as the major
                                            stockholders.
